# 🧠 Awesome Agent Benchmarks

[![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

A curated collection of the world’s most advanced benchmark datasets for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) Agents. Covers core capabilities including **tool use**, **multi-turn dialogue**, **code generation**, **planning & reasoning**, and **real-world task execution**—empowering researchers and developers to efficiently assess agent performance.

---

## ✨ Why This Collection?

As LLM Agent technology advances rapidly, standardized benchmarks have become the essential “ruler” for measuring real-world capabilities. However:

- Datasets are scattered across GitHub, Hugging Face, and paper appendices—hard to discover  
- Lack of unified taxonomy and key metric comparisons makes cross-evaluation difficult  
- New benchmarks emerge constantly, leading to outdated or incomplete lists  

**AgentBench Navigator** solves these problems by offering:
- Manually vetted, high-quality agent evaluation datasets  
- Structured categorization and metadata  
- Continuous updates to keep pace with the latest research  

Save hours of research time—get straight to what matters.
